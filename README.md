BusAlertAndroidApp
==================
In order to run the app you an download the APK from the app store with the name "BusAlert".

If you want to work on the code, you will need to be using the Eclipse SDK and import the project files found in this repository. Install the Google Maps API v2 tools from google using the Android Developer Console. See the link here on instructions to do that: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start

After that you can install an Android emulator using the Android Developer Console, or you can connect a phone and run the app from there. You will have to be careful with the release key, as it is tied to my account and project. It would be good practice to use the Eclipse debug key for debugging purposes and to create a new Android Release Key for release of the app. Here is a guide on how to publish apps: http://androidistic.com/1510/how-to-publish-apps-on-google-play-store/ .
